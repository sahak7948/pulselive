# Introduction

The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate your ability to use 
Java to build a dynamic football league table generator.

#Task

Consider a league table for football. Each team plays a number of matches and the results
of each match build the table. Given the code attached as a starting point build
the LeagueTable class that can take a list of completed matches and produce a sorted 
list of LeagueTableEntry objects.

LeagueTableEntry objects are sorted by points, goal difference, goals for and then team names. 
The normal rules for scoring points apply.

Your code will be run through a series of JUnit tests to validate the implementation so it is important 
that method signatures are not changed. You will also be assessed on code quality and clarity.

In undertaking this task, please consider the following:
- You should be submitting production quality code
- Future reuse and extension of code
- Any documentation / notes on build
